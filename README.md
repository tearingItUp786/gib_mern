A test project for the warehouse I used to work. Also my first ever MERN app!  
:smiley:  
To get started run you need to run the following commands and have *mongodb* installed

```javascript
  npm install
  npm run dev:server
  npm run dev:client
```

## Formatting and linting
I have included npm scripts that will handle formatting and linting if your code editor doesn't have the necessary defaults set. I will set up a pre commit hook that'll handle this so that we don't have to fight over stylystic things!

```javascript
  npm run format
  npm run lint:fix
```
